# SoundSwitch
SoundSwitch makes it easier to switch playback devices (sound cards).

Normally, to switch a Playback device you need to right click the sound icon in the bottom right corner of your screen (system tray),
choose "Playback devices" and then change the default playback device.
Every time you want to switch.

With SoundSwitch you just configure once between which Playback devices you want to toggle and then you can press Ctrl+Alt+F11 to toggle automatically!

## Dependencies
You need .NET 4.5.2 installed to work: [Microsoft .NET Framework 4.5.2 (Offline Installer)](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=42642) 

You also need [Visual C++ Redistributable for Visual Studio 2015](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=48145)

## Configuration
Right click the SoundSwitch icon in your system tray and choose Settings.
Now select the devices between which you want to toggle.
Optionally you can also change the keyboard combination, by default this is {Ctrl + Alt + F11}
If you want the application to start automatically when your pc boots up, check the box "Run at startup".

## Usage
Press Ctrl + Alt + F11 to cycle though the playback devices.
(Or a different key combination if you changed it)
